The manga scripts download manga chapters from various websites and save them to user-specified folders on their local machine. The user is prompted to select the path where the manga folder should be created, and the script creates a folder with the appropriate name at the selected path if it doesn’t already exist. The script then downloads all available chapters of the manga from the website and saves each chapter in a separate subfolder within the manga folder. Each page of a chapter is saved as an individual image file within the corresponding chapter subfolder.The createPDF.py merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF file. The user is prompted to select the path of the folder containing the chapter folders, and the script creates a list of PDF files in that folder sorted by chapter number. The user is then prompted to enter the name of the final PDF file, and the script merges the PDF files into a single PDF file with that name. The final PDF file is saved in the same folder as the chapter folders. Each chapter is bookmarked in the final PDF file, allowing the user to easily navigate between chapters.
